# Distributed low-level communication framework

Author: Sayantani Bhattacharya

## Project Objective:

 1. Enable peer-to-peer communication among agents/nodes.
 2. Optimize for low latency and network efficiency in unreliable environments.
 3. Enable custom msg packet options.
 4. Provide message queuing, user-friendly logging, and reliable delivery mechanisms.
 5. Allow cross-compilation among Ubuntu/Linux/RasberryPi systems.
 6. Work in offline environments where traditional networking (Wi-Fi/GPS) may not be available.
 
## Application:
I plan to use it as the communication layer of the Unitree Quadraped Fleet, as a part of my winter project.</br>
To enable collaborative exploration and criticality detection in dangerous/diaster regions.</br>
